# Proposal: issue-107-theia-migration-design

## Why
We need a clear, shared design baseline for the Theia migration so architecture, IPC, and storage decisions stay consistent across the sprint and reduce rework.

## What Changes
- Draft sprint-theia-migration design docs: architecture, TipTap focus/shortcut strategy, IPC migration mapping, and storage model comparison with recommendations.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `openspec/specs/sprint-theia-migration/design/*`
- Affected code: none
- Breaking change: NO
- User benefit: clearer migration plan with explicit decisions and tradeoffs
