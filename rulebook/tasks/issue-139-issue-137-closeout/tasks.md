## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Archive Rulebook task folder for Issue #137 into `rulebook/tasks/archive/`.
- [x] 1.2 Confirm the repo has no pending `rulebook/tasks/issue-137-*` entries.

## 2. Testing
- [x] 2.1 Run `git status --porcelain` to ensure the change-set is only the archive move.

## 3. Documentation
- [x] 3.1 Keep `openspec/_ops/task_runs/ISSUE-139.md` up to date (commands + key output + evidence).
