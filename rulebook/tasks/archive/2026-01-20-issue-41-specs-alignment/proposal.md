# Proposal: Specs alignment (roadmap + Sprint 2 tasks)

## Goal
Bring OpenSpec docs back in sync with delivered work by:
- Updating the implementation roadmap status in `openspec/specs/writenow-spec/spec.md`.
- Adding missing Sprint 2 Judge Layer task cards (006-012) under `openspec/specs/sprint-2-ai/tasks/`.

## Scope
- Update roadmap section only (Sprints 1-4 + insert Sprint 2.5; keep Sprint 5-7 content unchanged).
- Create 7 task cards with consistent formatting and acceptance checklists.

## Non-Goals
- Implement Judge Layer code, UI, or database schema (this issue is docs/tasking only).
