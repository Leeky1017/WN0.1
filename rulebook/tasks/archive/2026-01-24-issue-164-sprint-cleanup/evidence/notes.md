# Notes — issue-164-sprint-cleanup

## Context
- Theia migration is complete; baseline should be `writenow-theia/`.
- Cleanup must avoid deleting anything still referenced by Theia runtime; if uncertain, keep and open follow-up Issue.

## Decisions
- Keep/remove decisions will be justified in RUN_LOG with evidence (rg references, import graph, runtime config).

## Later / Follow-ups
- (placeholder) Any kept legacy Electron pieces will be captured here with a proposed follow-up Issue.
